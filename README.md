# Sombrero

### A generator of random tests

This is __Sombrero__, a project whose aim is to ease the task of design tests, mainly for upper mathematics courses.

It sometime is a pain in the ass to design examination tests for courses that require proofs. If you make if right, you have to look for the exercises, solve them, maybe look for multiple proofs and shit like that.

With __Sombrero__ I want a tool to generate random tests selected from a database, which problem statements and solutions are written with TeX syntax and then it compile the document to give you a `pdf` with the problems and another one with the solutions.

A simple tool, but I just want to do it.
